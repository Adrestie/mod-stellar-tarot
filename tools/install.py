"""Installs mod-stellar-tarot into a server, and says everything it does.

    python tools/install.py --server <server dir> --core <azerothcore dir>
                            --client <client Data dir> | --no-client
                            [--locale enUS] [--backup vault|beside]
                            [--survey] [--dry-run]
    python tools/install.py --client-only --client <client Data dir>

`--server` is the directory holding `worldserver.exe`, `configs/` and
`lua_scripts/`. `--core` is the AzerothCore source tree, the one with a
`modules/` folder: the module's sources go there and the operator rebuilds.

A CLIENT IS NOT OPTIONAL. The module's items and spells exist in no client:
without its rows a card has no icon and an effect has no name. So
`--client` is asked for, and the only way past it is to SAY so with
`--no-client` -- for a server that has no client on it, which is most Linux
ones. That server's operator then patches a client of his own, on the machine
where it lives, with `--client-only`: that mode needs no server and touches
no database.

WHAT IT DOES, IN ORDER

  1. SURVEY   reads which identifiers the target already uses -- in the
              server's DBC files and, if a client is given, inside its
              archives -- and compares them with the module's own.
  2. BACKUP   copies aside every file it is about to write, and dumps every
              table it is about to change. Nothing is written before this.
  3. PLACE    the sources, the interface and the configuration.
  4. SQL      the world files, then the characters files, in order.

`--survey` stops after the first step: it reads and reports, and writes
nothing at all. `--dry-run` goes through every step announcing what it would
do, and writes nothing either.

  5. CLIENT   when one is given: merges the module's DBC rows into the
              client's own files and writes them, with whatever art the module
              ships, into `patch-Z.MPQ` -- a NEW archive holding only that when
              the client has none, or INTO the client's own when it already
              has one. In the second case each file it replaces is copied
              aside first, nothing else in the archive moves, and the archive
              keeps a record of what the module put in it.

WHEN THE MODULE IS ALREADY THERE -- its sources under modules/, its
interface, its configuration, its tables in the world database, or its rows in
the client's archive -- the installer does not install: it says what it found
and REMOVES the module instead, with `--keep-characters` or
`--drop-characters` saying what becomes of what players earned. To update the
module, remove it, then install it again. `--presence` only asks the question:
exit code 3 when the module is there, 0 when it is not, nothing written.

`--shift` allows the survey's answer to be acted on: when an identifier is
taken -- on the server, in its database, or in the client, the client's own
`patch-Z` included -- the module's own are moved out of the way, in every
file of the module, before anything is written. Without it the installer
stops and says what is taken.
