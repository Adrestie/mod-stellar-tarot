"""Reading and writing WDBC files, the client database format of 3.3.5a.

A DBC is four header integers, then fixed size records, then one block of
NUL terminated strings. A record holds only integers, floats and OFFSETS INTO
THAT BLOCK -- a string field is an offset, never text.

Which fields are offsets is not written anywhere in the file, and the core's own
format strings do not say either: they mark with `x` every field they ignore,
and some of those are strings (the spell description and tooltip, for instance).
So the layout is DEDUCED from the file, by `string_fields` below, and the
deduction is checked against thousands of records before it is trusted.

# of thirty bytes, an integer worth 1 is a valid offset, and a merge would
