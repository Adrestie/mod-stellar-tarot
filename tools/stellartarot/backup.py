"""Keeping a copy of everything before it is touched.

NOTHING IS WRITTEN BEFORE ITS PREVIOUS STATE IS KEPT. That is the whole rule,
and it holds for files and for database tables alike. What the installer cannot
put back, it does not touch.

Two places to keep them, and the operator chooses:

  vault     a `Backups/` folder inside the module's own directory, reproducing
            the path of each file underneath it. Everything in one place, easy
            to keep or to throw away in one gesture.
  beside    a copy next to the original, under the same name with a suffix.
            Nothing to look for: the copy is where the file is.

The second is what makes an archive safe to overwrite. A client archive is
copied FIRST, beside itself, and only then written into -- so a conflict inside
it is resolved on a file whose previous state is already on disk.

Every backup writes a receipt saying what was kept and where it came from, so a
restore needs nothing but the backup folder.
