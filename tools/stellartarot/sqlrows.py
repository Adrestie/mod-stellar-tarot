"""Reads the rows out of an INSERT statement.

Enough SQL to read what this module writes, and no more: a column list, then
tuples of numbers, quoted strings and NULL. It exists so that the authoring
tools can take the module's own SQL as their source rather than a running
database -- the SQL is what the module ships, and it is the same on any machine.
