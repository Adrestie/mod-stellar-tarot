"""Reading MPQ archives, the format the 3.3.5 client keeps its data in.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The installer cannot decide anything about a client without
looking inside it: which identifiers are already taken, whether a texture is
there, whether an interface file has been modified. StormLib does that, but it
is a 32 bit library and nothing guarantees a matching interpreter on the
machine of whoever installs the module. So the reading is done here, in the
language the rest of the installer is written in, and it depends on nothing.

WHAT AN ARCHIVE IS. A header, a hash table and a block table, then the files.
The two tables are encrypted with a key derived from their own name, using a
table of numbers the format generates from a single seed. A file is found by
hashing its path three times: once to pick a slot, twice more to confirm the
name, because the archive does not store names at all.

This module reads, writes a new archive, and writes INTO an existing one -- the
last for a client that already carries a patch of its own in the top slot.
