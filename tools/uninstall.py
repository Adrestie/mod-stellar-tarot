"""Removes mod-stellar-tarot from a server, and says everything it does.

    python tools/uninstall.py --server <server dir> --core <azerothcore dir>
                              [--client <client Data dir>] [--mysql <dir>]
                              [--keep-characters] [--dry-run]

THE DATABASE IS UNDONE BY THE MODULE'S OWN SQL. Every file under data/sql
deletes what it is about to insert -- that is what makes it replayable.
Collected on their own, those DELETE statements are exactly an uninstaller,
and one that cannot drift from the module: change what a file writes, and the
way to remove it changes with it. Two things are added: the module's OWN
tables are dropped rather than emptied, because they belong to nobody else;
and the statements run in reverse file order, so what a later file added is
gone before an earlier one is undone.

WHAT PLAYERS EARNED IS KEPT unless you say otherwise. The characters database
holds the binders -- the cards and boards each account studied -- and the
layouts; `--keep-characters` (the default is to ask) leaves those tables where
they are, so that a reinstall finds them again.

THE FILES are the ones the installer placed: the sources under modules/, the
interface under lua_scripts/, the configuration, and the client's patch-Z.MPQ.
When that archive is the module's own it is removed whole. When it is the
client's -- the installer wrote INTO a patch the client already had -- the
archive stays: the module's rows are taken out of each DBC it merged into,
and the files it added are removed, from the record the installer left inside
the archive. A rebuild of the core is then yours, as it was after installing.

`--dry-run` prints every statement and every path, and touches nothing.
